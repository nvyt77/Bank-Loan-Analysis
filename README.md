## Technologies Used

- **Power BI**: For data modeling, data visualization and reporting.
- **Microsoft SQL Server**: For data extraction and manipulation.

## Introduction
In today's dynamic financial environment, the capacity to effectively monitor and analyze lending activities has emerged as a critical factor for maintaining competitive advantage and building enduring customer trust. As a leader in the financial industry, Bank of America acknowledges the pivotal role that data-driven decision-making plays in the management of its loan portfolio. To thrive in this landscape, it is essential to develop tools and resources that enable precise tracking of lending performance, insightful analysis of market trends, and informed strategic planning.

The proposed Bank Loan Report aims to serve as a comprehensive repository of vital loan-related metrics, facilitating deeper insights into the lending operations and overall portfolio health. By leveraging accurate and timely data, Bank of America will be better positioned to enhance its lending practices, improve borrower satisfaction, and continue its tradition of responsible and effective lending.

### Project Objectives
The objective of the Bank Loan Report project is to develop a comprehensive and visually engaging report that systematically monitors and assesses the bank's lending activities and performance. This report will track key metrics, including:
- Total Loan Applications
- Funded Amounts
- Repayment Statistics
- Borrower Assessments

By integrating critical loan-related metrics and analyzing their temporal changes, the report will facilitate a deeper understanding of the health of the loan portfolio and highlight emerging trends that can shape our lending strategies. Additionally, we aim to create a detailed **Details Dashboard** that consolidates essential loan information, offering users a holistic view of vital metrics and data points.

## Problem Statement
Bank of America is committed to providing transparent and efficient loan services to its customers, necessitating a comprehensive analysis of its loan performance to enhance decision-making and improve lending strategies. This involves examining key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:
- Total Loan Applications
- Total Funded Amount
- Total Amount Received
- Interest Rates
- Debt-to-Income Ratios

By systematically tracking and visualizing these metrics, the analysis aims to uncover trends over time, analyze borrower profiles, and pinpoint areas for improvement in loan quality.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
### General Questions
1. **Total Loan Applications**: How many loan applications were received during the specified period, and what are the Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes?
2. **Total Funded Amount**: What is the total amount of funds disbursed as loans, including the MTD Total Funded Amount and MoM changes?
3. **Total Amount Received**: What is the total amount received from borrowers for loan repayments, with analysis on MTD total received and MoM changes?
4. **Average Interest Rate**: What is the average interest rate across all loans, and how do MTD and MoM variations in interest rates reflect on our lending portfolio costs?
5. **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**: What is the average DTI of borrowers, and what is MTD and MoM fluctuation in this ratio?

### Good Loan vs Bad Loan KPIs
